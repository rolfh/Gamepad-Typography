					<h1>
						Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an
						English mathematician, computer scientist, logician,
						cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.
					</h1>

					<h2>
						During the Second World War, Turing worked for the
						Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley
						Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra
						intelligence.
					</h2>

					<p>
						Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted
						coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the
						Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle
						of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.
						Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the
						effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war,
						but at the upper end it has been estimated that this
						work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years
						and saved over 14 million lives.
					</p>
					<h3>Early life and education</h3>
					<h4>Family</h4>
					<p>
						Turing was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father,
						Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from
						his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) at
						Chatrapur, then in the Madras Presidency and presently
						in Odisha state, in India. Turing's father was the son
						of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert Turing, from a
						Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the
						Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing's mother,
						Julius' wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney
						1881–1976), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief
						engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a
						Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County
						Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had
						spent much of her childhood in County Clare.
					</p>

					<p>
						Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British
						India, where his grandfather had been a general in the
						Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their
						children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to
						Maida Vale, London, where Alan Turing was born on 23
						June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside
						of the house of his birth, later the Colonnade Hotel.
						Turing had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir
						John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing
						baronets).
					</p>

					<p>
						Turing's father's civil service commission was still
						active and during Turing's childhood years Turing's
						parents travelled between Hastings in England and India,
						leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army
						couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge,
						Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a
						blue plaque. The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012,
						the centenary of Turing's birth.
					</p>

					<p>
						Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius
						that he was later to display prominently. His parents
						purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived
						there during school holidays. The location is also
						marked with a blue plaque.
